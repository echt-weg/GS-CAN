# GS-CAN
GS-CAN is a simple and basic implementation for adding features to a CANaerospace-bus in coexistence with [Kanardia-Devices](https://www.kanardia.eu) on the bus.
GS-CAN is still under development and will offer different features in 3 Sub-Projects
- GS-CAN-2WIFI: Hardware + software for sending received canbus-frames via websocket to Wifi-Clients
- GS-CAN-MULTI: Hardware + software for sending data, based on analog-measurements + I2S-data, to the bus
- GS-CAN-VIZ: Web-based visualization for (via GS-CAN-2WIFI) received data (from Kanardia-Devices and from GS-CAN-MULTI)
- GS-CAN-SPEC: Specification for non-conflicting sending data to the bus

The Hardware uses ordinary and cheap components for easy building devices on your own.

# Warning
When using GS-CAN (on a shared bus) you can produce unexpected erros. A missworking device (in Software or Hardware) can damage devices as well as showing wrong data. GS-CAN will never be certified and is only allowed to use on your own risk on your own responsibility. Please take notice of the applicable regulations.

## Hardware
The hardware is based on popular dev-boards. In common all you need for the GS-CAN-2WIFI as well as for the GS-CAN-MULTI is a 2x19pin ESP32-Devoard like a ESP32 NodeMCU-32S and a CAN-Transceiver with a SN65HVD230-Chip (I'm using CJMCU-230-boards). Caution: There are a lot of "Fake-CAN-Transceiver" which will receive data but aren't able to send! Additional to these components you only need some wires, resistors and perhaps a DC-DC-Stepdown like a LM2596-board. The total-costs will be about 8-25 EUR. The layout is simple and you can produce a perfboard on your own. I will publish PCB-Layouts later.
If you are interested in a pcb you can also contact me. I have some testing-pcbs in spare. The GS-CAN-MULTI-Hardware can also run the GS-CAN-2WIFI-Code.

## 1st Steps
Get some ESP32s-boards, CAN-Transceiver, wire them together and start playing with the code!
